Title: Glyph Scatterplot Matrix (Glyph SPLOM)
Version: 0.99.0
Author: Andrew D. Yates
Maintainer: Andrew D. Yates <yates.115@osu.edu>
Description: Glyph SPLOM is a data visualization and exploration tool like an enhanced correlation heatmap that can be used to infer directed networks from unordered, numeric data. It combines a non-linear measure of dependency strength, distance correlation, and a four-quadrant dependency class to quantify dependencies in an all-pairs dependency matrix. gsplom provides tools to efficiently compute, visualize, cluster, and analyze this matrix.
